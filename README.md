My answers to freeCodeCamp.org ["Data Analysis with Python"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python) certification projects.

If you intend to pass the certification yourself, be aware that you should not actually read any of the code presented here, as it could make you unintentionaly violate freeCodeCamp.org [academic honestly policy](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/academic-honesty-policy/). Instead, I recommend you go through the official librairies documentation (pandas and seaborn in particular) which are full of extensive examples, making your work for the certification pretty easy.
